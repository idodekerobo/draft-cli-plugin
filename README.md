# Draft — Claude Code + Codex CLI

**Draft is a PM brain for Claude Code and Codex CLI.** Install it once, run `/setup`, and every session starts with full product context — no re-explaining required.

> **Platform support: macOS and Linux only.** The plugin's session hook is a bash script and requires a POSIX shell environment. Windows (including WSL) is untested and not currently supported.

---

## Quick start

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add idodekerobo/draft-cli-plugin
/plugin install draft
/draft:setup
```

### Codex

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idodekerobo/draft-cli-plugin/main/scripts/codex-setup.sh | bash
```

Restart Codex, then run:

```
$draft-setup
```

That's it. Draft loads your product context automatically on every session start.

## Why Draft

You open a new Claude session. It doesn't know what you shipped last week. It doesn't know you changed the ICP. It doesn't know you dropped that feature. You're back to square one — again.

That's the default. Every session starts blank.

Draft fixes two things that make this worse over time:

**Context amnesia** — the blank slate problem. Without Draft, you're re-explaining your product, your stack, your priorities at the start of every session. It's not just annoying — it means Claude is reasoning from whatever scraps you happened to paste in, not from a real picture of what you're building. Draft's `SessionStart` hook injects a live snapshot of your full product context (company, product, team, priorities, memory) before you type a single word.

**Context rot** — the slow decay problem. Even if you have a `CLAUDE.md` or context files, they go stale. You shipped something, changed direction, dropped a bet — and your docs still describe the old world. The longer you work, the more your context diverges from reality. Claude is confidently reasoning from a version of your product that no longer exists.

Draft solves this with an append-only log and a persistent index of recent changes. Every time something meaningful happens — a decision, a scope change, something shipped or dropped — `draft-learner` logs it and updates the index. That index loads in every session automatically. So even if your full context documents haven't been touched in weeks, the session always knows what just happened.

The feeling: your AI CLI behaves like a collaborator who was in every previous session — not a new hire you brief from scratch each time.

## Installation

### Claude Code

**Option 1 — Plugin marketplace (recommended):**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add idodekerobo/draft-cli-plugin
/plugin install draft
```

Then run the setup interview:

```
/draft:setup
```

**Option 2 — Local install (for testing/development):**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./draft-cli-plugin
/draft:setup
```

The plugin's `SessionStart` hook handles everything else automatically on first launch.

### Codex

This is a **direct install**, not a Codex plugin. The setup script writes directly into your `~/.codex/` directory — no plugin marketplace involved.

**Option 1 — curl (no clone needed):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idodekerobo/draft-cli-plugin/main/scripts/codex-setup.sh | bash
```

**Option 2 — from a local clone:**

```bash
bash ./scripts/codex-setup.sh
```

The script installs seven things:
1. Creates `~/.draft/workspace/` with a blank context/memory structure
2. Installs `inject-context.sh` to `~/.codex/hooks/draft/`
3. Registers the `SessionStart` hook in `~/.codex/hooks.json`
4. Enables the `codex_hooks` feature flag in `~/.codex/config.toml`
5. Installs sub-agent TOML files to `~/.codex/agents/`
6. Writes pm-agent instructions to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
7. Installs the `$draft-setup` skill to `~/.agents/skills/draft-setup/SKILL.md`

After the script completes, restart Codex, then run:

```
$draft-setup
```

> **Note on `$` prefix:** `$draft-setup` is how Codex invokes skills. The `$` prefix is Codex-specific — slash commands (like `/draft:setup`) are Codex built-ins only and cannot be extended by external installs.

## How it works

### Agent architecture

Draft uses an orchestrator + three sub-agents pattern. The pm-agent is the main thread — it handles all PM work and delegates to specialists.

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| `pm-agent` | **Orchestrator.** Owns all PM behavior. Delegates to the three agents below. |
| `draft-researcher` | Need to KNOW something — reads workspace files, fetches web content |
| `draft-executor` | Need to DO something — writes PRDs, decision docs, updates files |
| `draft-learner` | Need to REMEMBER something — updates context files, logs decisions |

Most requests follow: `draft-researcher` gathers context → `draft-executor` acts → `draft-learner` saves.

#### Claude Code
`settings.json` activates `draft:pm-agent` as the main Claude Code thread. Every session opens with the pm-agent system prompt rather than the default Claude Code prompt.

#### Codex
`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` contains the pm-agent instructions and loads as persistent context for every Codex session. Sub-agents are installed as custom agent `.toml` files in `~/.codex/agents/`.

---

### Context loading

There are two layers of context loaded at session start:

**1. Agent system prompt — static**

The pm-agent's instructions define:
- PM role and orchestration behavior
- Delegation rules and when to use each sub-agent
- Document writing flow and template selection
- Context staleness policy (7-day / 21-day)
- Proactive memory rules and what's worth persisting
- Onboarding detection (auto-starts setup interview if no context exists)

**2. Workspace context (`scripts/inject-context.sh`) — dynamic**

Runs on every `SessionStart` via hook. Executes four commands and outputs the results directly into the session context:

| Command | What it injects |
|---|---|
| `tree` | Two-level directory listing of `context/` |
| Python script | Frontmatter from each `context/*/index.md`: name, description, last_updated, source |
| `cat priorities/index.md` | Full current priorities file |
| `cat memory/memory.md` | Full memory — vocabulary, preferences, patterns, goals |

The pm-agent uses this as its orientation layer. When a task needs more detail than the frontmatter provides, it reads the relevant file in full.

---

### Session lifecycle

#### Claude Code — first session (after install)

1. **`SessionStart` hook fires** → runs `scripts/session-init.sh`
2. **Workspace bootstrap** (guarded — runs once): copies `workspace-template/` → `~/.draft/workspace/`
3. **`~/.claude/settings.json` updated** (guarded — runs once): sets `DRAFT_WORKSPACE` env var, adds `~/.draft/workspace` to `additionalDirectories`, grants `Read/Write/Edit` for `~/.draft/**`
4. Settings take effect on the next session start

#### Claude Code — every subsequent session

1. `session-init.sh` guards pass, exits in <10ms
2. `inject-context.sh` runs — outputs live workspace snapshot into session context
3. `draft:pm-agent` activates as main thread
4. pm-agent is oriented: context dimensions, freshness, priorities, memory

#### Codex — after running `codex-setup.sh`

1. `SessionStart` hook fires → `inject-context.sh` runs, outputs workspace snapshot as developer context
2. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (pm-agent instructions) loads as persistent context
3. pm-agent is oriented and ready

## Workspace layout

Both Claude Code and Codex share the same workspace at `~/.draft/workspace/`:

```
~/.draft/workspace/
├── context/
│   ├── company/index.md + log/
│   ├── product/index.md + log/
│   ├── user/index.md
│   ├── team/index.md + log/
│   ├── priorities/index.md + log/
│   ├── decisions/
│   └── tensions.md
├── memory/
│   └── memory.md
├── docs/
│   ├── prds/
│   └── decisions/
└── templates/
    ├── prd.md
    └── fang-decision-doc.md
```

The workspace lives outside `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` intentionally — it's shared across both CLIs.
